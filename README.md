Final project for Digital Humanities 140 (Coding for Humanities), taken in Summer 2025 with Prof. Nicholas Sabo.

For this project, I wanted to use the New York Times as a case study to explore hidden biases in reporting. To accomplish this, I will use the New York Times' Archive API to scrape article metadata and filter the results. I have chosen to analyze data in the first month following October 7th, focusing the topic of the articles while still leaving a large enough set to work with.
